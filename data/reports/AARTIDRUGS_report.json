The holding decreased from 59.57% in March 2023 to 57.13% in March 2024, a reduction of 2.44 percentage points over one year.</li><li><b>Potential Implications:</b> Such a steady decrease in promoter holding can be a negative signal, potentially indicating a lack of long-term conviction in the company's prospects or a need for liquidity for other ventures. While the holding remains above 50%, the trend is a significant concern for minority shareholders.</li><li><b>Institutional Absorption:</b> The shares offloaded by promoters appear to have been absorbed primarily by Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs), whose holding increased from 4.09% to 5.99% in the same period. This provides some comfort, as professional investors are showing increased interest.</li></ul>",
