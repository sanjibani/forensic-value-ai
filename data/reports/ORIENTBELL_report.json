Promoters hold a high, stable, and unpledged stake, suggesting a deep-seated commitment. Yet, this comforting image is shattered by a single, glaring fact that serves as our primary headline risk: the company operates in a near-total vacuum of institutional ownership. This **absence of sophisticated capital** is not an accident; it is a loud, silent alarm. When the professional money managers, with all their resources for due diligence, collectively decide to stay away, we must ask what they have seen that the retail market is missing. The answer, it appears, is a story of engineered optics and questionable governance.\n\nThe mechanism at play is a calculated strategy of **projecting stability while manipulating underlying performance**. Our investigation uncovers clear evidence that FY2018 profits were materially inflated by non-operating and one-time accounting entries, creating a misleading picture of core operational health. This was not an isolated incident. We see a pattern of aggressive and volatile tax accounting",
