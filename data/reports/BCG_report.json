Such explosive growth is highly unusual and warrants extreme scrutiny, especially in the absence of a clear, transformative business event.</li><li><b>Suspicious Margin Stability:</b> Despite this massive revenue volatility, the Operating Profit Margin (OPM) remained rigidly stable at 29-30% for nearly a decade (FY2015-FY2023). In a genuine business environment, rapid scaling typically impacts margins due to increased competition, marketing spend, and integration costs. This unnatural stability is a classic indicator of earnings management, where expenses may be manipulated to align with potentially inflated revenue figures.</li></ul>",

It is highly questionable how the company funded a ~160% increase in sales over two years (FY21-FY23) without raising debt, especially when also not retaining significant cash from operations.</li><li><b>Negligible Dividend Payout:</b> Despite reporting soaring net profits, culminating in \u20b91,371 Cr in FY23, the company has a history of zero or negligible dividend payouts. In FY23, the payout was 0%.</li><li><b>Conclusion:</b> The combination of massive reported profits, a supposed debt-free balance sheet, and a refusal to share profits with shareholders via dividends is a major red flag. It strongly suggests that the accounting profits are not backed by actual cash flow, and the reported earnings may be fictitious. The absence of a Cash Flow Statement prevents direct calculation of the CFO/PAT ratio, but these P&L indicators are sufficient to infer a critical divergence.</li></ul>",
