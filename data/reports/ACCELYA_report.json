This prioritizes short-term cash distribution over reinvestment for future growth or building a financial buffer for downturns.</li><li><b>Governance Concern:</b> This policy may indicate a strategy to upstream maximum cash to the parent/majority shareholders, potentially at the expense of minority shareholders' long-term interests and the company's financial health.</li></ul>",
